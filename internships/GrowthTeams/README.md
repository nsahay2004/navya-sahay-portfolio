Description: I worked as a data science intern for the NGO Growth Teams (Jan- March 2025). I worked on creating a pipeline that would identify 100 sector success stories based on the trading data of all countries in the database. In my role, I did the following: 

* Built and developed ETL pipelines for efficient data processing using Python
* Analyzed sector data across multiple countries to compute economic growth and identify trends.
* Created data visualization of trends to effectively communicate insights using advanced computational tools.
